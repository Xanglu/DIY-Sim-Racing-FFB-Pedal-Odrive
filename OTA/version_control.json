You can now enter Wi-Fi credentials, choose the update channel, and review the changelog before proceeding. Available only when using FW OTA or Plugin Update.\n- Plugin version: 0.90.07\n\nRudder\n- Switched force reading filter from velocity-based Kalman filter to exponential filter with a noise factor of 200.\n- Updated movement filter from average filter to Kalman filter."
