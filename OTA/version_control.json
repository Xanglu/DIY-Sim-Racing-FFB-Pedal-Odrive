    "changelog": "\nFOR USER WHO USE PCBA V2 or PCB V3 and its verison is 0.90.15 or below, please update this build via USB, DO NOT UPDATE VIA OTA\n\n0.90.21:\nPedal:\n1. Implemented the new software wireless assignment across all supported boards, eliminating the need for hardware DIP switch adjustment.\n2. The sensor value from the bootlog will now be printed out in the bridge log monitor via ESPNOW when booting up.\n3. All effect amplitudes (amps) have been updated to be expressed as a % of the force range.\n4. Added Threshold force settings for effects.\n5. Fixed a bug that caused effects to be missing in the rudder.\n6. DAP version: 160\n7. Firmware version: 0.90.21\n\nBridge:\n1. New software assignment applied.\n2. DAP version: 160\n3. Firmware version: 0.90.21\n\nPlugin:\n1. New software assignment UI added.\n2. Added new serial COM port scan functionality.\n3. Removed the CDC serial option for PCBA v1.2, switching to auto-scan the COM port. If a CDC serial is detected, the related action will be automatically applied.\n4. All effect amps have been changed to the form of % of force range.\n5. Added a global effects setting tab, which includes the Threshold force slider for effects.\n6. DAP version: 160\n7. Plugin version: 0.90.21\n\n0.90.20:\nPedal\n1. Replaced the stepper library with a custom one, resulting in better smoothness.\n2. Hardcoded the pedal tuning parameters; PID and MPC tuning options are no longer available.\n3. The pedal control strategy is now fixed as PID control with P gain: 0.02, I gain: 0.5, and D gain: 0.0.\n4. Fixed an issue where the LED was initialized twice.\n5. Fixed an issue causing a wireless role assignment error; this happened when the local config waited to be written to the global config, but another function was already reading the config.\n6. DAP version: 158\n7. Firmware version: 0.90.20\n\nBridge\n1. DAP Version: 158\n2. Firmware version: 0.90.20\n\nPlugin\n1. Removed the Control Strategy, PID, and MPC tabs.\n2. Added a directly upload from PlatformIO mode option in the OTA window (Note: Do not use this option).\n3. Renamed effects fps to effects update rate.\n4. DAP version: 158\n5. Plugin version: 0.90.20\n\nRudder\n1. The rudder control strategy remains as MPC control with a 0th gain of 6.0.\n\n0.90.19:\nPedal\n1. Replaced USB stack libraries with Adafruit TinyUSB and recreated the joystick libraries.\n2. Added debug flag 32 to reset default servo tunes.\n3. Added a delay to get the MAC address, which fixes an issue where the MAC address was not being overwritten for ESP-NOW.\n4. Removed an environment that is no longer maintained.\n5. DAP version: 156\n6. Firmware version: 0.90.19\n\nBridge\n1. Replaced USB stack libraries with Adafruit TinyUSB.\n2. Created the libraries for the joystick.\n3. Bridge debug mode now prints joystick values when they change.\n4. DAP version: 156\n5. Firmware version: 0.90.19\n\nPlugin\n1. Removed the delay in the SimHub game data session.\n2. Refactored action sending.\n3. Changed the action interval to Effect FPS. This option only works with the paid version of SimHub; the free version is limited to 10 FPS.\n4. DAP version: 156\n5. Plugin version: 0.90.19\n\n\n0.90.18:\nPedal :\n1. Fixed an issue where a MAC address overflow caused a boot loop.\n2. Firmware version: 0.90.18\nBridge:\n1. Firmware version: 0.90.18\nPlugin:\n1. Plugin version: 0.90.18\n\n0.90.17:Pedal:\n1. Runtime improvements.\n2. Removed the BLE gamepad function on PCB V3 due to RAM capacity concerns.\n3. General code refactoring.\n4. DAP version: 156\n5. Firmware version: 0.90.17\n\nBridge\n1. Separated Serial TX and RX into different tasks to improve runtime \n2. performance.\n3. Added a task scheduler for better task handling.\n4. Actions and configurations are now saved in a buffer.\n5. Implemented a new message queue for debug messages.\n6. General code refactoring.\n7. DAP version: 156\n8. Firmware version: 0.90.17\n\nPlugin\n1. Fixed a bug that caused an incorrect CRC to be sent when enabling the rudder.\n2. DAP version: 156\n3. Plugin version: 0.90.17"
